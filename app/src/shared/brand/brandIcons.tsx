/**
 * Module: `@shared/brand/brandIcons`
 * Purpose: Single registry mapping a repo-spec `intent.brand.icon` NAME (PascalCase
 *   Lucide name) to its component, plus a `<BrandIcon>` renderer. ONE place resolves
 *   a node's brand mark so the header, gallery card, og:image, and favicon all draw
 *   the same icon from the same source — no per-fork hand-coded AppHeader JSX.
 * Scope: Pure presentational + a name→component map. No data fetching, no repo-spec IO.
 * Invariants:
 *   - CURATED_SET: only the network's chosen brand icons are bundled (keeps the icon
 *     payload tiny vs. importing all of lucide-react). Add a node's icon here when it
 *     declares a new `brand.icon`.
 *   - SAFE_FALLBACK: an unknown/absent name renders the neutral `Hexagon` mark, never throws.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: app/src/app/.well-known/agent.json/route.ts, app/src/app/opengraph-image.tsx
 * @public
