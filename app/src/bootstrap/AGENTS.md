> Scope: this directory only. ≤150 lines. Do not restate root policies.

## Metadata

- **Owners:** @derekg1729
- **Status:** stable

## Purpose

Application composition root. Provides environment validation and dependency injection wiring for runtime.  
System setup installers were moved to `scripts/bootstrap/` and are out of scope here.

## Pointers

- [Root AGENTS.md](../../../../AGENTS.md)
- [Architecture](../../../../docs/spec/architecture.md)
- [Platform bootstrap (installers)](../../../../scripts/bootstrap/README.md)

## Public Surface

- **Exports:**
  - `verifySystemTenant(serviceAccountService)` - Startup healthcheck: fails fast if cogni_system billing account missing (per SYSTEM_TENANT_STARTUP_CHECK)
  - `runGovernanceSchedulesSyncJob()` - Job: advisory lock + governance schedule sync via container
  - `getContainer()` - Singleton DI container with logger and config
  - `resetContainer()` - Reset singleton (tests only)
  - `Container` interface - Ports + logger + config (includes accountsForUser(userId), serviceAccountService, metricsQuery, metricsCapability, repoCapability, toolSource, threadPersistenceForUser(userId), modelCatalog, providerResolver; no usageService)
  - `ContainerConfig` interface - Runtime config (unhandledErrorPolicy, rateLimitBypass, DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT)
  - `resolveIdentityBindingDependencies()` - Identity binding adapter/clock/randomness composition; policy remains in the feature service
  - `UnhandledErrorPolicy` type - `"rethrow" | "respond_500"`
  - `getTemporalWorkflowClient()` - Process-wide Temporal WorkflowClient singleton (race-safe init, cleaned up by resetContainer)
  - `resolveAiAdapterDeps()` - AI adapter dependencies for factory
  - `createGraphExecutor(completionStreamFn, userId)` - Factory for the static inner GraphExecutorPort router (from `graph-executor.factory.ts`)
  - `createScopedGraphExecutor({ executor, billing, preflightCheckFn, resolver, actorId, abortSignal?, broker?, commitByoUsage? })` - Per-run wrapper: resolves LlmService from ModelProviderResolverPort, applies billing/preflight/observability/usage-commit decorators, seeds ALS ExecutionScope
  - `runGraphWithScope({ executor, req, ctx?, billing, llmService, abortSignal? })` - App-local helper that seeds per-run ALS scope with resolved LlmService
  - `createAgentCatalog()`, `listAgentsForApi()` - Discovery factory (from `agent-discovery.ts`)
  - `wrapRouteHandlerWithLogging()` - Route logging wrapper with metrics (from `http/`)
  - `wrapPublicRoute()` - Lazy singleton wrapper for public routes with rate limiting (from `http/`)
  - `makeWrapPublicRoute()` - Pure factory for testing (from `http/wrapPublicRoute`)
  - `RateLimitBypassConfig` - Test bypass config type (from `http/wrapPublicRoute`)
  - `TokenBucketRateLimiter`, `publicApiLimiter`, `extractClientIp` - Rate limiting utilities (from `http/`)
- **Env/Config keys:** none (uses `@/shared/env`)
- **Files considered API:** `container.ts`, `graph-executor.factory.ts`, `agent-discovery.ts`, `identity.ts`, `http/index.ts`, `http/wrapPublicRoute.ts`, `http/rateLimiter.ts`

**Subdirectories:**

- `ai/` - AI tool bindings and tool source factory
- `capabilities/` - Capability factories (MetricsCapability, RepoCapability, WebSearchCapability)
- `http/` - Route wrappers and rate limiting
- `jobs/` - Job modules (advisory lock + container wiring for CLI-invoked tasks)

## Responsibilities

- This directory **does**:
  - Dependency injection wiring with singleton container
  - Factory functions for adapter construction and per-run executor composition (e.g., createGraphExecutor, createScopedGraphExecutor, createAgentCatalog)
  - Sandbox provider registration (LazySandboxGraphProvider + SandboxAgentCatalogProvider, gated by LITELLM_MASTER_KEY; sandbox adapter loaded via dynamic import to avoid Turbopack bundling native deps)
  - Discovery factory for agent listing (listAgentsForApi per DISCOVERY_PIPELINE invariant)
  - Environment-based adapter selection (APP_ENV=test → fakes, production → real adapters including RipgrepAdapter)
  - Logger initialization (one per process)
  - Route logging wrapper with type-safe auth config (envelope-only)
  - Public API rate limiting (10 req/min/IP + burst 5) with test bypass via wrapPublicRoute()
- This directory **does not**:
  - System installation or platform configuration
  - Handle request-scoped context (see `@/shared/observability`)
  - Map domain errors to HTTP responses (routes handle locally)

## Usage

Bootstrap application runtime dependencies.

## Standards

- Environment validation before startup
- Clean dependency injection patterns

## Dependencies

- **Internal:** ports, adapters, shared, types
- **External:** Node.js runtime

## Change Protocol

- Update this file when **bootstrap interfaces** change
- Bump **Last reviewed** date

## Notes

- System installers moved to scripts/bootstrap/
- Focus on runtime composition only
