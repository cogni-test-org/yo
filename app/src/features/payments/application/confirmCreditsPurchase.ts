/**
 * Module: `@features/payments/application/confirmCreditsPurchase`
 * Purpose: Application orchestrator — composes credit confirmation with treasury settlement and the TigerBeetle Split-distribute co-write.
 * Scope: Orchestrates the post-credit chain: credit user → settle treasury (Split distribute) → record the Treasury→OperatorFloat USDC movement in TB.
 *   Steps 1-2 (credits) always succeed independently. Steps 3-4 (settlement, TB) are non-blocking — log critical on failure.
 *   `runPostCreditFunding` is extracted so both the widget path (confirmCreditsPurchase) and on-chain path (verifyAndSettle) can invoke post-credit steps.
 * Invariants:
 *   - Credit confirmation always succeeds independently of downstream steps
 *   - Settlement skipped on idempotent replay
 *   - SETTLEMENT_NON_BLOCKING: Steps 3-4 never fail the user response
 *   - CO_WRITE_NON_BLOCKING: TigerBeetle writes fire-and-forget
 * Notes: The dead OpenRouter/Coinbase provider top-up path (old steps 5-6: the provider funding port + the OperatorFloat→ProviderFloat co-write) was retired — OpenRouter 410'd programmatic crypto top-up. Inbound crediting + Split distribute are unchanged.
 * Side-effects: IO (via delegated ports)
 * Links: docs/spec/financial-ledger.md, task.0086
