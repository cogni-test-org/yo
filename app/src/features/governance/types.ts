/**
 * Module: `@features/governance/types`
 * Purpose: View model types for governance UI — client-side composition of ledger API data.
 * Scope: Type-only module. No runtime imports. These are NOT API contracts; they are UI view models
 * composed from multiple ledger endpoints by hooks.
 * Invariants:
 *   - ALL_MATH_BIGINT: credit/unit values are strings (BigInt serialized)
 *   - UNIFIED_SCALE: units and override values share the same scale — no milli-unit conversion
 *   - avatar/color are placeholder defaults until a profile system exists
 *   - EpochView.unresolvedCount reflects events with no resolved user_id (IDENTITY_BEST_EFFORT)
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: src/contracts/attribution.list-epochs.v1.contract.ts, src/contracts/attribution.epoch-user-projections.v1.contract.ts
 * @public
