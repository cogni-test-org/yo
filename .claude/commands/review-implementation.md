You are a **critical senior engineer** performing an implementation review for: #$ITEM

**Reviews critique the through-line.** Start by re-reading the work item's `outcome` sentence — _"success is when {human|AI|system} can {do X}"_. The PR is acceptable only if a reasonable observer running on candidate-a could see that sentence become true. If the diff doesn't carry the success sentence to reality, that's a blocking issue regardless of how clean the code is.

Your job is to find bugs, style violations, and missed edge cases. Be the reviewer who catches the issue before production. Be direct, specific, and constructive — but never rubber-stamp.

Read these before starting:

- [Architecture](docs/spec/architecture.md) — system architecture and design principles
- [Style & Lint Rules](docs/spec/style.md) — coding standards
- [Feature Development Guide](docs/guides/feature-development.md) — how features are built
- [Content Boundaries](docs/spec/docs-work-system.md#content-boundaries) — ownership rules

Then find every AGENTS.md in the file path tree of the files being changed (start at root, descend into subdirs).

---

## Phase 1 — Understand the Change

1. Read the work item to understand the stated goal.
2. Read linked specs (`spec_refs`) — these are the contract the code must satisfy.
3. Run `git diff origin/main...HEAD` to see the full diff.
4. Read each changed file in full (not just the diff) to understand context.

---

## Phase 2 — Review Code

For each changed file, evaluate:

### Correctness

- Does the code do what the spec says it should?
- Are all invariants from the linked spec satisfied?
- Are edge cases handled (null, empty, concurrent, error paths)?
- Do tests cover the critical paths and edge cases?

### Style & Consistency

- Does it follow `style.md` rules (naming, imports, exports)?
- Does it match surrounding code patterns in the same module?
- Are there linting issues that `pnpm check` would catch?
- Are type annotations correct and specific (no `any` leaks)?

### Best Practices

- Are dependencies used correctly (no misuse of APIs, deprecated methods)?
- Is error handling present at system boundaries (external APIs, user input, DB)?
- Are security boundaries respected (no raw SQL, no unsanitized input, proper auth checks)?
- Is logging appropriate (structured Pino, correct levels, no sensitive data)?

### Performance

- Are there N+1 queries or unbounded iterations?
- Are large datasets paginated?
- Are expensive operations cached or batched where appropriate?
- Are there missing `await`s or dangling promises?

### Over-Engineering

- Are there abstractions that serve only one call site?
- Are there config options or feature flags for things that could just be code?
- Are there "just in case" error handlers for impossible states?
- Could any helper/utility be replaced by a standard library or OSS function?

## Phase 3 — Run Checks

```bash
pnpm check
```

Report any failures and whether they are pre-existing or introduced by this change.

---

## Phase 4 — Verdict

Output a structured review:

```
## Implementation Review: [work item ID]

### Summary
[1-2 sentences: what was implemented and how]

### File-by-File

#### `src/path/file.ts`
- **L42**: [ISSUE] Description of problem — suggested fix
- **L78**: [STYLE] Description of style issue — how to fix
- **L120**: [GOOD] Notable positive pattern worth preserving

#### `src/path/other.ts`
...

### Blocking Issues
[Any issues that must be fixed before merge, with specific fixes]

### Suggestions
[Non-blocking improvements worth considering]

### Check Results
- `pnpm check`: PASS / FAIL (details)

### Verdict: APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES
```

### Post-Verdict Actions

**Are you reviewing your own PR (self-review)?** Then YOU are the implementer — go to "Self-Review" below. Filing follow-up bugs, flighting, or handing to `/validate-candidate` is NOT a substitute for fixing.

**If APPROVE (peer review):**

1. Set work item `status: done`, update `updated:` date.
2. Run `pnpm check:docs` and fix any errors until clean.
3. Commit all changes on the work item's branch. Push to remote.

**If REQUEST CHANGES (peer review):**

1. Increment `revision:` field in work item frontmatter (e.g., `revision: 0` → `revision: 1`).
2. **LOOP_LIMIT check**: If `revision >= 5`, set `status: blocked` with `blocked_by: Review loop limit — escalate to human` instead of sending back to implement.
3. Otherwise, set `status: needs_implement`.
4. Add blocking issues to the work item's `## Review Feedback` section.
5. Run `pnpm check:docs` and fix any errors until clean.
6. Commit all changes on the work item's branch. Push to remote.

### Self-Review (you wrote the code AND are reviewing it)

The whole point of self-review is to fix issues before they reach a human. Listing blockers and walking away defeats the loop. This is the most common failure mode for this skill — read carefully.

**Required sequence after writing the verdict:**

1. **Address every BLOCKING issue in code on the same branch.** Do not flight, do not request human review, do not move on. If the verdict says REQUEST CHANGES, the next action is `Edit`/`Write`, not `gh pr ...` or `vcs/flight`.
2. **Apply every SIMPLIFYING suggestion** (dead code, redundant abstractions, inlinable constants, removable shims). Simplifications on your own diff are free wins; the cost of skipping them is the cruft compounding. Non-simplifying suggestions (style nits, doc tweaks) are optional.
3. **Filing a follow-up `bug.*` work item is NOT fixing.** Only file a follow-up when the blocker is genuinely out of scope (touches a different node, requires a different spec, expands the PR beyond its `outcome`). State the scoping reason explicitly in the bug body. "I'd rather move on" is not a scoping reason.
4. **Do not flight (`vcs/flight`) until the self-review blockers are fixed and pushed.** Flighting a build the reviewer (you) just said REQUEST CHANGES on burns the candidate-a slot and lies to the validation loop.
5. After fixes are pushed and CI is green, re-run the verdict pass on the new HEAD. Only then proceed to flight + `/validate-candidate`.

**Allowed deferrals:**

- Cross-surface consistency issues that would multiply the diff size — file a follow-up bug, link it from the PR description, AND explicitly scope the current PR in its description (not just in chat).
- Issues whose fix requires a spec/architecture decision the user hasn't made.

Anything else: fix it now.

## Rules

- **READ_THE_FULL_FILE** — never review only the diff. Understand the context around every change
- **SPEC_IS_CONTRACT** — if the spec says X, the code must do X. Flag any deviation
- **CITE_LINE_NUMBERS** — every issue must reference a specific `file:line`
- **NO_RUBBER_STAMPS** — if you found no issues, you didn't look hard enough. Re-read the diff
- **OSS_OVER_BESPOKE** — flag custom code that duplicates well-maintained OSS functionality
- **TEST_THE_EDGES** — if edge cases aren't tested, flag them as missing coverage
- **LOOP_LIMIT** — if `revision >= 5` after increment, auto-block instead of sending back to implement
- **FIX_DON'T_DEFER** — on self-review, every BLOCKING issue gets fixed in this pass; filing a follow-up bug or flighting first is forbidden unless the blocker is genuinely out of scope (and you state the scoping reason in the bug body)
- **APPLY_SIMPLIFICATIONS** — on self-review, simplifying suggestions on your own diff (dead code, removable abstractions, inlinable constants) are applied, not just listed
- **NO_FLIGHT_BEFORE_FIX** — never dispatch `vcs/flight` on a SHA you (the reviewer) just verdicted REQUEST CHANGES. Fix, push, re-verdict, then flight
