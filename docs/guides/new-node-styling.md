# New Node Styling Guide

Each Cogni node owns its visual identity while sharing the app shell and layout patterns. The first pass usually means editing five files under `app/src/`.

> **Design quality:** this guide is the _where_ (which files to edit). For the _what_, use the `node-styling` skill (`.claude/skills/node-styling/`) — it makes the mission the driver and routes the homepage build to `/frontend-design`. Don't ship a one-token recolor and call it a customization; design the homepage for the mission.

## 1. Logo and Name

Files:

- `app/src/features/layout/components/AppHeader.tsx`
- `app/src/features/layout/components/AppSidebar.tsx`
- `app/public/*`

The current template uses image logo assets:

```tsx
<Image
  src="/TransparentBrainOnly.png"
  alt="Cogni"
  width={24}
  height={24}
/>
```

For a fast rebrand, replace the public image assets and update visible labels from `Cogni` to the node name. If the node has a better symbolic identity, use a `lucide-react` icon in both header and sidebar:

```tsx
import { Activity } from "lucide-react";

<Activity className="size-5 shrink-0 text-primary" />
<span className="font-bold">
  cogni<span className="text-primary">/poly</span>
</span>
```

Examples:

| Node     | Icon              | Import         |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Operator | `Brain`           | `lucide-react` |
| Poly     | `Activity`        | `lucide-react` |
| Resy     | `UtensilsCrossed` | `lucide-react` |

## 2. Theme Colors

File:

- `app/src/styles/tailwind.css`

Set the `--primary` CSS variable in both `:root` and `.dark`. The accent gradient and sidebar variables should use the same hue family.

Key variables:

```css
--primary: 160 65% 45%;
--ring: 160 65% 45%;
--sidebar-primary: 160 65% 45%;
--sidebar-accent: 160 25% 17%;
--sidebar-ring: 160 65% 45%;
--accent-from: 164 75% 38%;
--accent-to: 164 90% 55%;
--accent-glow: 164 85% 45%;
```

Search for the current hue numbers, for example `217` and `222.2`, then update both light and dark sections.

## 3. Metadata

File:

- `app/src/app/layout.tsx`

Update the metadata export:

```tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Cogni Poly - Community AI Prediction Trading",
  description: "Your node description here.",
};
```

## 4. Homepage

Primary file:

- `app/src/features/home/content.ts` ← **edit this**

The template now ships a full, multi-section landing page (the same shape the Poly
and Resy nodes use): an animated hero with a live agent-stream console, a "showcase
cards" grid, a public "activity feed" of explainable signals, and a closing stats
band. You do **not** rebuild this layout per node — the layout components in
`app/src/features/home/components/*` are generic and read everything from
`content.ts`.

A first-class customization is **words + colors**:

1. Open `content.ts` and walk it top to bottom. Replace every placeholder —
   `HERO`, `AGENT_STREAM_SEQUENCES`, `SHOWCASE_*`, `FEED_*`, `STATS` — with copy and
   data that sell **your** node's mission. Keep the data _shapes_; change the values.
2. Set your brand hue in `tailwind.css` (section 2 above). The hero gradient,
   pills, bars, and feed all follow `--primary` / `--accent-*` automatically.

That's it for most nodes. The page (`app/src/app/(public)/page.tsx`) composes the
sections and redirects signed-in users to `/chat`; you rarely touch it. Only edit
the components in `components/*` if you need to add or remove a whole section.

> Reference customizations: Poly (prediction markets — "Bet smarter. Together.")
> and Resy (reservations) both started from this exact framework and changed only
> content + hue. Aim for that bar, not a one-token recolor.

## 5. Chat Defaults

Files:

- `app/src/features/ai/components/ChatComposerExtras.tsx`
- `graphs/src/index.ts`

Tailor the default graph and graph list to the node's domain. Prediction-market nodes should expose market-analysis prompts and graphs; reservation nodes should expose reservation workflows; general nodes can keep `langgraph:brain`.

## The README is yours

A minted node ships node-template's `README.md`, which opens `# node-template` and then
describes the template — layout conventions, image tags, what the deploy plane omits.
Rewrite it to describe YOUR node.

**Why this is a first-class step and not a nicety.** The README is the first thing a
human or an agent reads on the repo, so it is identity in exactly the sense
`.cogni/sync-manifest.yaml` uses the word. That file's rule is:

> a node's IDENTITY and PRESENTATION are its own; the shell and the contracts are not.

`README.md` is therefore carved out as Tier-3 (`node_local`), the same treatment
`app/src/styles/tailwind.css` received after every sync overwrote each fork's design
tokens with node-template's. Tier-3 means node-template never clobbers your copy — so
unlike the app shell, this file is safe to diverge and yours to own.

**Source the mission from one place.** Lead with `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` `intent.mission`,
the same field feeding the homepage hero. Two hand-written descriptions of the same node
drift; one source cannot.

## Checklist

- [ ] Update logo or icon in header and sidebar.
- [ ] Update visible node name and external links.
- [ ] Rewrite `README.md` (see "The README is yours" below).
- [ ] Pick a primary hue and update `tailwind.css` light and dark variables.
- [ ] Set `layout.tsx` metadata.
- [ ] Customize the public homepage by rewriting `app/src/features/home/content.ts` (hero, agent stream, showcase cards, activity feed, stats).
- [ ] Customize chat graph defaults and suggestions.
- [ ] Verify `pnpm check` passes.
- [ ] Verify the dev server shows the expected logo, colors, and name.
