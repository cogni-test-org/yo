# Add a Node Secret

A node developer owns the secret declaration and typed consumption. The value is written through the operator — a node-owner can now self-serve it with only an API key (no kubectl, no OpenBao token).

## Secret or Plain Config

Use this guide only for credentials: API keys, tokens, webhook secrets, private signing material, and passwords.

Plain non-sensitive config belongs in typed app config and the operator-owned deployment overlay, not in a secrets catalog.

## 1. Declare the Shape

If `.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml` does not exist, create it (a commented stub ships in this template). Add one entry for the node-owned key:

```yaml
- name: MY_NEW_KEY
  tier: A2
  appliesTo: web
  shared: false
  source: human
  required: true
  category: "Vendor Name"
  description: One line describing what consumes this key.
  steps:
    - "Create the key in the vendor dashboard."
```

Use `source: agent` only for values that automation can generate safely. Use `source: human` for vendor credentials.

## 2. Consume It in Code

Read `process.env.MY_NEW_KEY` through the node's typed env boundary. Required secrets must fail fast at startup if missing. Do not silently continue with `undefined`.

Do not log secret values, request headers, tokens, cookies, or full vendor payloads.

## 3. Set the Value

The value never enters git, PR comments, chat, or committed YAML. Two paths write it to OpenBao:

**Self-serve via the operator (you, the node owner — the default, agent-friendly path).**
First, an owner grants you OpenFGA `secrets_manager` on this node (operator Agents UI →
"Manage secrets" — a distinct, least-privilege grant, not bundled with "Flight"). Then you
set the value through the operator with only your **API key** — no kubeconfig, no OpenBao
writer token:

```
POST https://<operator-host>/api/v1/nodes/<node-id>/secrets
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
content-type: application/json

{ "key": "MY_NEW_KEY", "value": "…", "op": "set" }     # op:"rotate" to rotate

→ 200 { "written": true, "version": <n>, "path": "cogni/<env>/<node>/MY_NEW_KEY" }
```

The operator authorizes the write **per-node** (`can_manage_secrets`, fail-closed), refuses
**reserved substrate keys** (your node owns its own namespace — any non-reserved key is
allowed; the catalog in step 1 is for typed consumption + shape, **not** a write gate), and
writes with its **own** in-cluster OpenBao identity — your key never carries cluster custody.
ESO + Stakater Reloader then carry the value into the running pod. Confirm with the `version`
in the response (no `kubectl` needed).

### Holding `secrets_manager` is safe — it's authority, not custody

This is the error to avoid: thinking the grant gives you operator-level / cluster
power and declining it. It does not. `secrets_manager` is the secrets twin of
`developer`/`production_promoter` — **per-node, least-privilege.** Two separate things:

| | **You** (grant holder = authority) | **The operator** (mediator = custody) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hold | only an API key | the OpenBao writer identity (projected SA token, kube) |
| reach | **only `cogni/<env>/<your-node>/*`** | mediates the write; enforces the gates |
| see | the `version` you wrote | never hands you a value; other nodes are invisible to you |

So **request it for your node.** You never receive the writer token, a kubeconfig,
cross-node reach, or any value but your own — the operator *mediates* the write, which
is not the same as you holding operator power. Declining the grant and asking an operator
to "just run it for me" is the **legacy admin path being retired** — it re-inserts a
privileged human into every secret write and forfeits your node's self-sovereignty.

> **`503 secrets_plane_config_missing`?** This env's operator doesn't have the secrets-writer
> identity provisioned yet. candidate-a is live; preview/production roll out with the operator
> deploy — ping the operator team rather than reaching for the CLI.

**Ops / deploy-env owner (fallback).** Whoever holds the env's OpenBao writer role can
also write it directly:

```bash
pnpm secrets:set <env> <node-slug> MY_NEW_KEY
```

Either way, the operator side owns ExternalSecret wiring, pod `envFrom`, DB/DNS
provisioning, and rollout. A node PR should not edit those surfaces.

## What Not to Touch

- Do not commit a Kubernetes `Secret`.
- Do not add a per-key `valueFrom` line to a pod spec.
- Do not create a per-key ExternalSecret YAML.
- Do not paste the value into a PR, issue, chat, or shell history.
- Do not edit operator `infra/catalog`, Argo, or environment overlays from this node repo.

## PR Proof

- `.cogni/secrets-catalog.yaml` declares the key shape.
- The typed env boundary validates the key if code requires it.
- Tests or startup checks prove missing required config fails loudly.
- `pnpm check` passes.
