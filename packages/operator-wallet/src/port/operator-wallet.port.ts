/**
 * Module: `@cogni/operator-wallet/port`
 * Purpose: Operator wallet port — narrow, typed interface for outbound on-chain payments.
 * Scope: Defines the operator wallet interface. Does not implement custody logic or hold key material.
 * Invariants:
 *   - NO_GENERIC_SIGNING — the port has no `signTransaction(calldata)` / `signMessage(bytes)` surface.
 *   - KEY_NEVER_IN_APP — no raw key material.
 * Side-effects: none (interface definition only)
 * Links: docs/spec/operator-wallet.md, work/items/task.0315.poly-copy-trade-prototype.md
 * @public

/**
 * Operator wallet port — a bounded payments actuator.
 * Each outbound transaction type gets a named method. No raw signing surface.
 *
 * Polymarket CLOB order signing is NOT on this port: it is handled directly
 * in the trader-role runtime via `@privy-io/node/viem#createViemAccount`,
 * which produces a viem `LocalAccount` that `@polymarket/clob-client` consumes
 * natively. Wrapping that in a bespoke port added no value — see task.0315 CP2.

	 * the operator wallet's only generic-value outbound, and it stays within
	 * NO_GENERIC_SIGNING because the method encodes a fixed ERC-20
