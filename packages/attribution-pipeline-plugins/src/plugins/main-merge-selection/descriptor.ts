/**
 * Module: `@cogni/attribution-pipeline-plugins/plugins/main-merge-selection/descriptor`
 * Purpose: Direct-to-main selection policy — a contribution IS a PR merged to `main`.
 * Scope: Pure selection logic. Does not perform I/O or access the store.
 * Invariants:
 * - SELECTION_POLICY_PURE: receives context, returns decisions — no store writes.
 * - MAIN_MERGE_IS_CONTRIBUTION: `pr_merged` with `baseBranch === "main"` is included.
 *   `review_submitted` on a merged-to-main PR is included (visibility). All other
 *   event types (and merges to non-main branches) are excluded. Excluded logins are
 *   always `included: false`.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: packages/attribution-collect/src/activities/ledger.ts, docs/spec/attribution-ledger.md
 *
 * Why this exists: `promotion-selection.v0` was built for a staging→main promotion
 * model where a direct-to-`main` PR is a "release PR" (reference data, NOT a
 * contribution). The repo merges feature/fix/chore PRs DIRECTLY to `main`
 * (canary/staging retired), so under promotion-selection every real PR is excluded
 * and epochs always have zero claimants. This policy is the inverse for the
 * direct-to-main workflow: the merge to `main` is the contribution.
