/**
 * Module: `@cogni/attribution-pipeline-contracts/selection`
 * Purpose: Selection policy contracts — determine which receipts are included in an epoch.
 * Scope: Types, context interface, and dispatch function. Does not perform I/O or contain side effects.
 * Invariants:
 * - FRAMEWORK_NO_IO: this module contains zero I/O.
 * - SELECTION_POLICY_PURE: policies receive context and return inclusion decisions — no store writes.
 * - SELECTION_POLICY_PLUGGABLE: adding a new selection policy requires zero changes to the framework.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/plugin-attribution-pipeline.md
 * @public
